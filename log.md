**Today's Progress**: Replace NextWeekPage with NextWeekForecastPage with code improvment

**Thoughts:** It tooks me more time for fixing bugs than implementing the new NextWeekForecastPage. Some bugs wasn't about my code but the latest version of firebase package.
At the end, I've also realized that my code wasn't so beautiful as I thought 6 months ago xD
